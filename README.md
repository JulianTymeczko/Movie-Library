# Main Task: Interactive Full-Stack Application

To create a real-world full-stack application that you’ll be able to showcase to potential employers.

* Use Node.js and Express.js to create a RESTful API.

* Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.

* Use MySQL and the Sequelize ORM for the database.

* Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.

* Use at least one new library, package, or technology that we haven’t discussed.

* Have a folder structure that meets the MVC paradigm.

* Include authentication (express-session and cookies).

* Protect API keys and sensitive information with environment variables.

* Be deployed using Heroku (with data).

* Have a polished UI.

* Be responsive.

* Be interactive (i.e., accept and respond to user input).

* Meet good-quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, follows best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, etc.).

* Have a professional README (with unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to deployed application).

Many contributions between group members.

## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT. To create a real-world application from scratch, we have used Lawrence Wilson's Audiobook, Cathy Tanimura's book on SQL., references for our style.css on Google, W3Schools, CSSPortal, Snyk and all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. Comments were added in JAVASCRIPT to show what was done and for what purpose. To complete the backend code, our group received the help of my tutor, Erik Hoversten. He helped cleaned up the code and fix multiple errors I have encountered while building this database.

## What we learned:

Me and Julian took initiative and challenged ourselves by seperating tasks between us. Julian took the initiative to concentrate fully on the frontend code and I took control of the backend code. For us, this task was extremely difficult but also rewarding eventhough our application is not fully functional. We both learned how important collaboration is during a project. Better communication between team members, increased productivity and improved morale. When team members are working towards a common goal, it can build on each other's ideas, strenghts and weaknesses while feeling like a successful team. This experience will definetely help us in the future.

## Future Development of Application: 

As of today, our application definitely needs MAJOR improvements especially with the backend code. We need to work on implementing the backend code with frontend code with RESTful API communication through an integration layer exposing the existing systems. This would help improve our application as a whole and once these implementations are completed the frontend code could be updated and hnelp wit the design aspects of our project.
